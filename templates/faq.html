      <h4>How do we contact YXEIX?</h4><p>
      Send email to
      <a href="mailto:info@yxeix.ca">info@yxeix.ca</a> for non-urgent issues,
      <a href="mailto:noc@yxeix.ca">noc@yxeix.ca</a> for urgent problem reports,
      or <a href="mailto:peering@yxeix.ca">peering@yxeix.ca</a> for peering requests.
      All inquiries will be held confidential.

      <h4>What speeds are supported?</h4><p>
      The preferred choice of connection will depend upon the location. 
	  Typical connections are 1Gb & 10Gb (SFP based).  
	  Please contact us for information on other port speeds.

      <h4>What other services can we pickup at the YXEIX locations?</h4><p>
      We would be happy to discuss once we are up and running. 

      <h4>How much do ports cost?</h4><p>
      1Gbps and 10Gbps connections are $1200/year with a one-time setup fee of 
	  $250 which includes an SPF and patch cable. For connection speeds faster than 10Gbps
	  please email us at <a href="mailto:peering@yxeix.ca">peering@yxeix.ca</a>.    

      <h4>How do we donate to YXEIX?</h4><p>
      YXEIX was built upon donations.  We are very interested in receiving
      SFP optics, switches, or money to continue our work.  We have listed
      our <a href="contributors.html">contributors on a seperate page</a>
      along with ways of donating.

      <h4>Does this operate like an ISP?</h4><p>
      Internet Exchanges are not ISPs (Internet Service Providers).
      No traffic, bandwidth or other services are being sold by YXEIX.
      <p>
      The simple, noble goal is to create a meeting place where
      Western Canadian networks can directly exchange some of their
      traffic efficiently on an ethernet switch without additional
      costs.
      <p>
      Many Internet Service Providers provide their services at the
      locations where YXEIX has switches.  YXEIX does not intend to
      compete with the internet service providers, but instead complement
      their services to improve local Internet performance.

      <h4>What limitations are there on traffic?</h4><p>
      Similar to AMS-IX and TORIX, the switch ports are configured with a
      variety of port-security features so that one peer cannot damage
      another's experience.  If port-security is triggered, the port
      will appear "dead" for a little while.<p>
      <ul>
      <li>Peers may place only a single MAC address on their port.  Use
          of more MAC addresses may trigger port-security features.
      <li>Only ARP, IPv4, and IPv6 traffic are allowed.  Other traffic
          may trigger port-security features.
      <li>Only one layer-3 router allowed per port.
      <li>The peering router must speak BGP.
      <li>Peers may speak BGP directly between each other.
      <li>Additionally, two YXEIX-operated BGP route servers are available
          to share routes in a easy and simple fashion.  As at other IX, these
          route servers operate using a feature called <b>AS transparency</b> --
          they do not prepend their own AS to the AS_PATH on the reflected
          routes, thus creating shorter (better) paths
<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-idr-ix-bgp-route-server-02#section-2.2.2">(IETF description)</a>.
          The session to the route servers should be configured to accept
          this situation, typically with a vendor-specific option such as
          "no bgp enforce-first-as"
          <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/ios_xe/iproute_bgp/configuration/guide/irg_route_server_xe.html#wp1059883">
          (Cisco IOS, Cisco IOS-XE)</a>,
          "bgp enforce-first-as disable" (Cisco IOS-XR),
          "no bgp-enforce-first-as" (Quagga and family),
          "enforce neighbor-as no" (OpenBGPD), etc</a>.
      </ul>
      <p>

      These requirements are not unique to YXEIX.  The introductions and
      sample configurations at
      <a href="https://www.ams-ix.net/technical/specifications-descriptions">
      AMS-IX</a> or
      <a href="http://www.swissix.ch/participation/equipment-configuration-bpg">
      SWISSIX</a>, or other internet exchanges can be valuable.
      Our operators will help peers, and hope to provide samples of
      our own in the future.

      <h4>Are there any rules?</h4><p>
      The internet exchange switch is a fabric shared by all peers.
      Peers must avoid doing anything which might overload the fabric,
      mis-direct traffic, or otherwise cause harm to any other peers.  If
      a peer shows a willful disregard for others, they will be
      disconnected by the operators.  The full set of
      <a href="rules.html">Exchange Participation Rules</a> are published.
      <p>
      While not a rule, we request that peers register themselves
      with <a href=http://peeringdb.com/>http://peeringdb.com</a>, because
      visibility there will encourage other networks to join as well,
      bringing more benefit to all.

      <h4>What is the process for getting connected?</h4><p>
      Send us an email telling us about your network and requesting a port.
      All inquiries will be held confidential.
      <p>
      Please see our <a href=locations.html>Locations list</a> for
      datacenter contact information to make arrangements for a cross-connect.
      <p>

      <h4>What other services can we expect?</h4><p>
      No other services at available at this time.
