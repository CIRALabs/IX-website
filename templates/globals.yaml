           <p>An IX (Internet Exchange) allows networks to interconnect on an open-access ethernet fabric -- providing low-latency, high-bandwidth, cost-effectively, in a locale.</p>"
        - "<h4>What is the benefit?</h4>
           <p>Networks can exchange traffic faster and better. ISPs, transit providers, DNS services, and content networks will congregate -- it is sensible to interconnect locally.</p>"
        - "<h4>How is traffic exchanged?</h4>
           <p>Traffic exchange is facilitated by BGP (Border Gateway Protocol). Networks must have an AS (Autonomous System) number to announce their routes to each other.</p>"
        - "<h4>Where is MonctonIX?</h4>
           <p>The MonctonIX switch is located at Fibre Center, 770 St George Blvd, Moncton, New Brunswick, E1E 2C6, Canada.</p>
